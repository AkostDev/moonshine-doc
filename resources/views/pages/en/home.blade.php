        MoonShine is a very handy and functional tool.
        However, to use it, you need to be confident in the basics of Laravel.
    </x-moonshine::alert>

    <x-p>
        <strong>Professionals</strong> - use all the features of Laravel without limitations,
        while getting the tools for work acceleration - "framework on framework".

    <x-sub-title>History of the name</x-sub-title>
    <x-p>
        What does MoonShine stand for? It's not exactly "moonlight": my idea is the name "moonshine".
        Literally, it's the independent making of a drink under illegal conditions in the dead of night.
        So I spent my spare time (mostly at night) developing this admin panel, making a quality product with heart,
        for my own use as well as for friends. Everything is already ready for use in your projects,
        created documentation describing the order of installation, customization and features.
        I invite interested users to use and develop MoonShine together.
    </x-p>

    <x-sub-title>Where to start?</x-sub-title>
