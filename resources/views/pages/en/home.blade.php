<x-sub-title>Hello Laravel user!</x-sub-title>
     <x-p>
         You are on an open source project dedicated to the "MoonShine" admin panel.
     </x-p>
     <x-p>
         I've been working on it for several years, and have used it on dozens of small projects, constantly tweaking it.
     </x-p>
     <x-p>
         What does moonshine mean? It's not exactly "moonlight" - my idea is the name "moonshine".
         The term means the independent production of a drink in illegal conditions under the cover of night :).
         So I developed this admin panel at night in my free time under the moonlight;)
     </x-p>
     <x-p>
         Everything is already ready for use in your projects, documentation has been created describing the installation, configuration and features.
     </x-p>
     <x-p class="font-bold">
         I invite interested users to use and develop Moonshine together.
     </x-p>
