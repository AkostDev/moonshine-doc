        The idea of Moonshine project is to create a versatile and customizable admin panel for Laravel projects.
        Almost all serious projects require an admin panel, and it takes a lot of time to create it.
        So I had the idea to make my own admin panel, but it's a huge job,
        and in a few years I managed to create a working version for the most common tasks.

        Recently, the CutCode community dedicated to Laravel received a proposal to create our own open source project,
        and I figured this was the right approach to make a good admin panel together
        by joining forces on a common cause.

        Everyone will benefit from the interaction - you will use a quality product that will always evolve.

        An active and vibrant community is the heart of the project. Therefore, the most active users will be encouraged.
        A preliminary idea on the form of encouragement is to create a system of donations.
        Donated money is distributed among the main development participants.
        Project MoonShine participates in the support program from JetBrains "Free License Programs" -
        active developers receive a license for products from JetBrains.

        My goal is to make the project a place where developers will want to come back.
        Only together we can make a functional and comfortable machine! Together we will do more than alone!
